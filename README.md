## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Axios
- React Custom Hooks
- Leaflet - For Map
- Tailwind CSS - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use leaflet and React leaflet to render solutions that involve maps. Leaflet is an open-source project, so it was very easy to implement. The docs were also pretty easy to navigate, regarding stuffs like types for Map mathods and components like LatLngExpression, LatLngTuples, etc.

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet Docs](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [React Leaflet Docs](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/)
- [Ipify Docs](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - This is an IP geolocation API platform which will be instrumental in implementing solutions involving accurately detecting IP locations.
